### About this Website
This Website is all about Downloading Movie, but it's fake, I just made it for practising.
The tools that I used to make this Full Responsive Website:
- HTML
- Pure CSS
- JS
- [NODEJS][nodejs]
  - [Express][express]
    - [Method-Override][method-override]
  - [EJS][ejs]
  - [UUID][uuid]

## How does this website work?

### Installing NODEJS
We need `NPM` in order for this Project to work, Without NODEJS -- The project isn't going to work.

### Installing Several files from Package Managers.
There is no need to Install them separately, I wrote the dependencies for you, Just run this in your terminal, It'll download for you.
```console
$ npm install
```

### After Installing
when you are finished with installing, then run it with a command such as:

```console
$ node app.js
```

## app.js

***** My app.js is the main file that you must run this file in order to see the Website *****
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Listening to ${port}`)
})
```

## Link of Trailer
You have to be more careful for pasting the link Address.
Don't take the link address from different website, becuase It won't work.
<br>
Just paste the embed link address from Youtube. here is the location:
```console
Youtube -> select a Trailer -> Share -> Embed -> copy the src link and paste it to the input.
```
