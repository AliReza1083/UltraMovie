## How does this website work?

### Installing NODEJS
We need `NPM` in order for this Project to work, Without NODEJS -- The project isn't going to work.

### Installing Several files from Package Managers.
There is no need to Install them separately, I wrote the dependencies for you, Just run this in your terminal, It'll download for you.
```console
$ npm install
```
